# Auto Remove Sidbery Snaphsots

## This fork ##
This fork changes it so the snapshots are cleared 5 seconds after a download is completed. 

## What it does ##
This extension simply removes sidebery snapshots from the download history. The snapshots themselves are not removed.

It checks the downlod history for anything matching the word "snapshot" and then selects any of those results that came from the Sidebery extension, and removes them from the download history.
